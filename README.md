**Java Language Parser**

This parser provides basic support for Java Language. I'm still working on improve them.

There has two version programs:

*Implemented by Java (Easy to understand but only has limited functions)

*Implemented by JavaCC (More powerful but to understand it must understand JavaCC firstly)

I'm trying to imprve the JavaCC version.

Some test files including.

To use JavaCC version, firstly the **simplejava.jj** file must be compiled by JavaCC, then use the **ParseTest.java** file to excute the generated Java code.
